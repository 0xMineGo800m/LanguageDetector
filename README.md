LanguageDetector
================

Detects which language you are currently typing in.
Java does not allow a global key listener. One must be inside the JAVA application window in order
for the listener to work. To the rescue comes JNativeHooks. This JAR allows to hook into the operation system, allowing for a global listener.

Future updates will include:
-Extra languages to pick from
-Minimize to system tray on Windows
